# MERN-CRUD-cars-database
Here I created a full stack web application making use of the MERN stack. In this app I created the back-end of the application using Express and the front-end using React.  I further create da MongoDB that stores information about cars in a collection called cars.

## To install:

1) Download the project folder 'Backend' onto your local desktop
2) cd 'backend' then run npm install and npm start
3) cd 'frontend' then run npm install and npm start
4) Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the web app!

## How to use:

To add car to the database: 
enter all form fields as specified by placeholders
click submit and the car will be added to the database

To update one car in the database:
enter all form fields as specified by placeholders as before 
but add in the id of the car you want to update
click submit and the car will be updated in the database

To delete one car in the database:
click delete button and the car will be deleted from the database

To update many cars in the database:
This is done by tracking the owner of car
enter all form fields as specified by placeholders as before (no need to update id here)
but make sure the owner is the same as the owner of the cars you want to update
click the update many button and the cars will be updated in the database
do not click submit as it will add another car.

## Thank you!
